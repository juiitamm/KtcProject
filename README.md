KtcProject
==========

Official KTC association web portal powered by ASP.NET MVC 3.

KTC is a variation of football developed for summer cottage conditions.
Main goal of the game is to kick a football to the roof of the cottage.

The aim of this project is to provide a tool for keeping track of the score in the game.
Later, the score could be stored and some long term statistics calculated based on them.

The nature of this project is learning and fun for the author.
